# Resume

I started this project as a way of keeping my resume up to date for employers and to act as a portfolio for my projects going forward.

I chose to use Elm, Elixir and Phoenix as a means to getting better at functional programming. 

To use this locally:
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Please note you will need to have postgres installed locally for this to run.
